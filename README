imgs2video

This complex program gives you video (tested with flv output format, h264 codec)
from your images (tested with jpg). Timestamps are taken from file modification date.

Requires libavformat, libavcodec, libavfilter; encoder libx264, muxer flv,
decoder and demuxer mjpeg, and filter hqdn3d if you want denoise.

Compatible with both ffmpeg.org and libav.org.
libav.org is author's advice, as community is more helpful.

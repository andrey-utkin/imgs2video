This toolkit is dedicated to continuous generation of timelapse video.
Use build.sh to build.
To make it all build successfully, run such a command previously (for DEB-based distros):
apt-get install git yasm cmake gcc g++ build-essential libvpx1 libvpx-dev

The launch point is daemon.sh, it takes a config file.
Config file template is in config-sample.i2v
